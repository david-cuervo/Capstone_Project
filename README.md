# Capstone Project
David Cuervo

### Objective
Explore the relationship between industrial toxic releases and the socioeconomic demographics of the neighborhoods they are in.

Do poorer neighborhoods or predominantly minority neighborhoods have more pounds of toxic releases compared to wealthier, white neighborhoods?

### Results
- Built linear and logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest models 
- Most accurate was the random forest: 45.22%

Important features are unclear

### Conclusions
- Findings are inconclusive
- Future studies could explore:
  - More states, not just Texas
  - The number of actual industries in a neighborhood, not the pounds of toxins released
  - Other sources of pollution such as: bus depots, water treatment facilities, municipal waste sites
